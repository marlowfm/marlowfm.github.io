Every Friday from 7pm to 9pm. 

Get your rock shoes on and your air guitar out, because your weekend starts here with two hours of non-stop rock classics. From hard rock, to glam rock, to blues rock - whatever your flavour, tune in to savour the best rock music you won't hear on any other radio station.
