Catching A Wave is the sounds of summer, surf, and good time rock & roll! You'll hear special features plus lots of current and vintage surf music as well as iconic artists like The Beach Boys, Jan & Dean, The Ventures, Dick Dale, and more. It's the only place that makes you feel like it's summer all year long!
