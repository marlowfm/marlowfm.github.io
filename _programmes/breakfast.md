Every weekday from 7am to 9am. 

Wake up and start your day in the best possible way. We'll bring you local, national, and international news, great music, bizarre stories, and entertaining chat. 

Tune in at 7.20am for the day's Cliffhanger - the trivia question that keeps you hanging on - and again at 8.20am for the answer. 

News headlines and entertainment news on the half hour. 

Traffic, trains, and weather at quarter past and quarter to.
