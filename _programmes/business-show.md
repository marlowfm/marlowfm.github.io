Every Thursday from 2pm to 3pm.

The Business Show - does what it says on the tin! Business discussions everyone can enjoy.

Sheila Docker and Laura Parker are joined by expert guests for business discussions based on business news stories they've found online.

Opinions will fly, but in the most good-natured way. It's a bit like the 10.30pm slot on the main TV news channels, but focussed on business news and ideas. And it's on the radio. And with more humour and entertainment. And with music. And sometimes with a Marlow focus. But apart from all of that, the same.

Of course, Sheila's and Laura's natural curiosity means they'll ask the questions we all want answered!

Do you love listening to the show? Have a business question, or a news item you want us to discuss? Get in touch and let us know!
