Every Thursday from 2pm to 3pm. 

The Business Show - does what it says on the tin! Business discussions everyone can enjoy. 

*"It's hello from me, and next week it'll be hello from him."* 

Mark Harris and Lawrence Wood host on alternate weeks, and are joined by expert guests for discussions led by business news and practical advice for business leaders. 

Our two hosts each have a slightly different format for their shows, though all their guests will share the who, what, when, where and why of their own businesses, and some of their knowledge and expertise gleaned from a wealth of experience. 

Mark's episodes will focus on the business news of the moment, deconstructing stories with a panel of guests to find valuable insights. Opinions will fly, but in the most good-natured way. It's a bit like the 10.30pm slot on the main TV news channels, but focussed on business news and ideas. And it's on the radio. And with more humour and entertainment. And with music. And sometimes with a Marlow focus. But apart from all of that, the same. 

If you want to read the business news stories that Mark and his guests are discussing, join the Facebook group for the show (the link's below) and you'll find links to them there. 

Lawrence will interview a single guest in depth, with a focus on how they promote themselves and their venture or enterprise. Guests will be encouraged to share loads of great tips and insights for businesses of every size. It's a bit like a post-networking 121 over a coffee and a Danish, except it's in a radio studio, or done over Zoom. Sadly, there's no snacks or beverages, but you can always enjoy a coffee and a Danish while you're listening. 

Of course, Mark and Lawrence will chip in with their own views too - after all, they're both just a teeny weeny bit opinionated. 

*"I love arguing with you because I'm invariably wrong."* - Mark to Lawrence (30 June 2020) 

*"You always ask the perfect question."* - Lawrence to Mark (frequently!)
