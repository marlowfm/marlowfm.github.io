Every Monday from 9pm to 10pm.

Tired of your traditional book clubs? Join Yasmin and Lily as they reimagine how we think about our favourite pieces of literature by taking a musical spin on character analysis. Read and listen along as the show explores a different book each week, picking the songs that would soundtrack the lives of iconic characters if they were walking among us today.
