Melissa Gale talks to 'real' people about their profession, industry, charity, area of expertise, personal journey, and passion. 

The focus of the show is on wellbeing, corporate social responsibility, and getting the balance 'right'. It's all about sharing positive, useful, and inspiring information, and raising awareness of what's going on around us and in our community. 

Melissa's particularly interested in talking about mental health wellbeing initiatives, and charitable and environmental good causes. Get in touch with her if you have something to share that can inspire and add value.
