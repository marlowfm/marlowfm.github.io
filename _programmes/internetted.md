Every Wednesday from 2pm to 3pm. 

Internetted is our show about tech, gadgets, and the internet, presented by Michael Bird and Rob Murgatroyd - a couple of blokes who are always being asked how to fix most of it. 

Each week, they keep you informed with the latest tech news, answer some of the common tech questions they're always asked, and submit one piece of old tech to the 'Retro Tech Museum' (it's a real and totally not made up thing).
