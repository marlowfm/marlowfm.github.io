Every Sunday from 2pm to 4pm. 

Two hours of alternative and indie music, unearthing hidden gems and belting out classic hits new and old. Join Ali Gray on a voyage of wonder and discovery of all things cult, offbeat and unusual! And you, too, can become that annoying person who says things like "I liked them before they were cool" and "My favourite band? You've probably never heard of them".
