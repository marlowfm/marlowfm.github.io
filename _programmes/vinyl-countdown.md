Jonathan Charles loves radio and music on vinyl. He spent three decades on BBC and commercial radio and television, and, wherever he travelled in the world as a foreign correspondent, he always took music with him.

Join him for The Vinyl Countdown as he tries to teach his son, Max, about some great vinyl from the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s. Jonathan also presents _The Best Disco In Town_, reminding you of those big disco and club dance hits to get you up on your feet.

Jonathan can often be seen walking along the riverside in Marlow, breathing in the Thames Valley air.
