Every Sunday from noon to 2pm.

Alan Price-Roberts, AKA The Friendly Alien, brings you the very best in classic and contemporary country, including Nashville's new releases in the first hour and some excellent Americana music in the second.

Alan's regular features include his album of the week, 'Then and Now' - comparing a particular artist's track from the past with their new release, and a rundown of the Nashville Country Top 10.
