Every Saturday from noon to 1pm. 

The Eurovision Show celebrates the music of Eurovision past and present - paying homage not just to the annual winners and some of the more famous entries, but to other lesser-known songs from throughout Eurovision's six-decade history too. 

There's also regular news from the song contest world, plus new music from, and interviews with, past Eurovision artists!
