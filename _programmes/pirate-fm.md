Every Thursday from 7pm to 9pm.

The Pirate FM DJs aim to supply the people with the music that officially-sanctioned radio doesn't play, or doesn't play enough of, and to present it in an authentic manner. Their mantra is a simple one: the music comes first.

If you're into classic album tracks, progressive rock and blues, or sublime singer/songwriters, and you love discovering 'new' music, you've found your musical home from home.

Join David G. Croft and 'The Two Ps in a Pod' Paul Mansell and Paul Minkkinen for two hours of extraordinary music you won't find played on any other radio station.
