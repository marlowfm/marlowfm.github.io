Every Sunday from 10pm to midnight. 

If you’re into reggae, be it ambient dub, dub, dancehall, lovers rock, ragga, rockers, roots reggae, reggae fusion, or soca, or simply the classics by Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, Toots and The Maytals, Jimmy Cliff, Sly and Robbie, Third World, Steel Pulse, Gregory Isaacs, Dennis Brown, Aswad, Capital Letters, or Black Uhuru - it's all here last thing on a Sunday.
