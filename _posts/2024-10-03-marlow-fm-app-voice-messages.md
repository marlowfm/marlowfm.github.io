The Marlow FM app gets better and better. You can now record a voice message inside the app and send it straight to our studios - and we might even play it out on air!

Just make sure you've downloaded the latest version, 1.10, from either [the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/marlow-fm/id1554678179){:target="\_blank"} for iOS devices or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lpgm.marlowfm){:target="\_blank"} for Android devices.

If you're shy, you can send us a text message from inside the app instead. You can still send normal texts and emails to the studios, but the new in-app services make getting in touch with us so much easier.

If you don't yet have our app, now's a great time to give it a go. As well as sending us messages, and listening to Marlow FM, of course, you can get up-to-date weather, traffic, and train information for Marlow, and see the latest posts from MyMarlow. And much more!
