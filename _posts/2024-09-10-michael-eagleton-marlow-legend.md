Everyone at Marlow FM is devastated to hear the news that our dear colleague and friend, Michael Eagleton, died on Monday 9th September. He’d been ill for some time, and was in hospital. He was a founding member of our wonderful radio station, and his many many programmes have been loved by thousands across the world.

Michael was born in Marlow, and had always lived here, in the same bungalow. For many years he ran a record and hi-fi shop in the town.

Michael got into jazz at a very young age. His father was a dance band musician, and there were many dance band and jazz 78s in the house, along with a wind-up gramophone. When most of his school friends were getting into rock ‘n’ roll, Michael’s first love of jazz stayed with him.

Michael ran the Marlow Jazz Club for more than four decades, and as a result counted many of the world’s top jazzmen amongst his friends.

We will remember this unique and very special man with much love, and our thoughts are with his wife, Ann, and everyone whose lives Michael touched.
