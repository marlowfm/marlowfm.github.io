We're delighted that Mike Read, star of radio and TV for more than 40 years, will join us as a guest presenter of *Breakfast* from Monday 16th November.

Mike, who lives near Cookham, will present the show live from our studios each weekday between 7am and 9am. 

There's a lot Mike can teach us, and we're sure his years of experience will rub off. We also hope having Mike on the team will increase awareness of [our current fundraising drive]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/donate/) to see the station safely into 2021. 

Mike Read said: "Marlow FM's my local radio station. I know how important it is to the community here, especially during lockdown, and I'm excited to present their breakfast show for a little while." 

Mike will stay with us until Christmas. He plans to start a new broadcasting venture in the new year. 

Our current *Breakfast* presenters will be appearing on other shows across the weekly schedule in the meantime. They have worked hard since the first lockdown, and are now looking forward to a lie-in.
