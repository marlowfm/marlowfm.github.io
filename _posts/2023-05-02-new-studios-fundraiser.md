We're raising money to build a new home in the grounds of Great Marlow School. Our current studio building at Longridge Activity Centre, from where we started broadcasting full time in May 2011, is scheduled to be demolished later this year.

The school has offered us the use of its old caretaker's garage. We hope to raise £50,000 to convert and extend the garage into a new accessible two-studio facility, and fit it out with some much-needed new equipment.

We're encouraging our supporters to donate to a GoFundMe campaign, or buy an engraved brick to be included in a supporters' wall that will take pride of place inside the building. [Full details are here.]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/donate) Other fundraising events are expected to take place around town in the coming weeks.
