Everyone at Marlow FM is sad to hear the news that our dear colleague and friend, Mark Harris, died on Thursday 24th April. He'd been undergoing treatment for cancer. Mark had presented weekly business programmes on the station for many, many years.

Mark was so well known in the local business community, as a generous mentor and a friendly networker.

Our thoughts are with his family, friends, and colleagues.
