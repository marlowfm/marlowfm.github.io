W﻿e've o﻿nce again made the shortlists in this year's [Community Radio Awards](https://communityradioawards.org.uk/finalist-revealed-for-the-community-radio-awards-2022/).

W﻿e're up for *Outside Broadcast of the Year* for our coverage of this year's Marlow Town Regatta and Festival. And member John Rumble is a finalist in the *Sage Person* category, which recognises people over the age of 60. 

I﻿t was difficult to decide on which outside broadcast to put forward - we do so many during the year, and everyone involved pulls together to make each one a success. And it's fantastic that John, who does so much behind the scenes, has got the recognition he deserves. 

Y﻿ou can \[see and listen to all of our entries here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/cra2022/).

The winners will be revealed in a ceremony in Bedford on 19 November. 

Good luck everyone!
