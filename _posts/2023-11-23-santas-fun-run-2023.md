This year's Santa's Fun Run in Marlow takes place on Sunday 3rd December, and we'd love you to support the Marlow FM team.

Marlow FM presenter Chris Zaremba is leading our efforts, and this year money raised will be put towards kitting out our new studio building, which is currently being built.

If you're able to send a donation our way, [our fundraising page is here](https://justgiving.com/crowdfunding/MarlowFM){:target="\_blank"}. Money is being collected until the end of December. Please don't delay - every pound counts! Thank you.
