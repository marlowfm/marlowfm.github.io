There are some exciting changes to our schedule this spring.

Our weekly environment programme, _The Eco Show_, ably steered by Toby Brown for more than four years, becomes _The Earth Show_ and moves to Sundays at 6pm. Toby has moved away from the area, and the show's original presenter, Dave Hampton, returns to Marlow FM to take over. Thanks, Toby, and welcome back, Dave!

Jules Herd's dynamic talk show, _On The Edge_, moves to Mondays at 7pm. Since it started last June, the programme has featured some truly inspirational guests and their stories.

Finally, new presenter Colin Moore brings a weekly music quiz, _The Hit Mix Challenge_, to the schedule - with a chance to win prizes! Colin's here every Monday at 2pm.

We hope you continue to enjoy these and our other fun and engaging programmes.
