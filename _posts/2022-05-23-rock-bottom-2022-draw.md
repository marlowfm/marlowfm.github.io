The one-day family-friendly music festival runs from midday until 10.30pm, and Marlow FM will be there. Headliners Noasis will be supported by a range of great bands to suit all tastes, including tributes to Abba and Dolly Parton, a 1960s skiffle and rock and roll band, and popular local bands Straight 8 and The Echo. 

Rebellion will be running the bar, and there'll be a cocktail trailer and a range of street food stalls. There'll also be entertainment for the youngsters. 

Tickets are available via the Rock Bottom link above, or from Rebellion Brewery (there's a discount for members). 

We'll announce the winner of the draw on *Drivetime* on Monday 20th June. Good luck!
