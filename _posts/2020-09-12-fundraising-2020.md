We have launched a new fundraising drive at [www.gofundme.com/f/marlow-fm-2020-fundraising-drive](https://www.gofundme.com/f/marlow-fm-2020-fundraising-drive){:target="_blank"}.

Normally we raise funds by doing outside broadcasts at events like the Marlow Town Regatta and Pub In The Park. Unfortunately, the coronavirus pandemic has meant that all the events we would usually attend have been cancelled. 

While our income has dried up, we still have bills to pay. We need to raise many thousands of pounds over the next few months to ensure that Marlow FM can stay on the air into 2021. 

If you're in a position to donate something towards your local radio station, no matter how small, we would appreciate it tremendously. Thank you.
