[The Duke](https://thedukebox.co.uk/){:target="\_blank"}'s Chrimbo Limbo Drag Bingo and Karaoke on 29th December raised an amazing £1,250 to help us move into our new home later this year.

Drag queen Selma Soul made her stunning debut, and kept everyone entertained, or on edge!

Thank you to everyone who came along, to our very own Laura Tilbury, to Janine Nowak for the photographs, and, of course, to The Duke for hosting this fantastic event.
