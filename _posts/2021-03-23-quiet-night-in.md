The Meals from Marlow organisation is to start a new fundraising drive on Saturday 27th March, and Marlow FM will be broadcasting a special event live from 8pm.

Our own Amelia Slaughter will be joined by a host of stars including Tom Kerridge, Chris Evans, and Russell Brand for *Marlow's Quiet Night In*, two hours of 'over-ambitious and amateurish nonsense' to celebrate Meals from Marlow and raise some money. 

Meals from Marlow delivers 750 meals a week to key workers and those in need in the local area, and the team now want to raise a minimum of Â£75,000 so that they can carry on their work. You can donate through [their GoFundMe page](https://uk.gofundme.com/f/meals-from-marlow-2021){:target="_blank"}. 

Listen to the fun and games on Marlow FM, or watch online on [Marlow TV](https://www.marlowtv.co.uk/){:target="_blank"}. 

The party will continue on Marlow FM with Kev Kinch from 10pm. 

Meals from Marlow was set up at the start of lockdown, and so far it's provided more than 100,000 meals. The project plans to become a permanent charity.
