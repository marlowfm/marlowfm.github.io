18-year-old Desborough College student Luke Jales has got an unconditional offer from Bath Spa University after working with our Training Director, John Rumble.

Luke needed to put together a portfolio of work to support his application for the degree in Creative Music Technology. With John's support and encouragement, Luke created an episode of our *Music Box* series to include in his portfolio. It will be broadcast on Marlow FM. 

John commented: "Luke started at ground zero, discovering that you need the skills of production, engineering, and presenting to do a show for community radio. He embraced all of these, and put them into practice in a professional broadcast studio. Luke went away with a great piece of work for his portfolio, and his university offer is well deserved."
