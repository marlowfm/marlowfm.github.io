Oliver Gratrick is one of five lucky winners of a competition organised by Buckinghamshire Council - and we at Marlow FM are delighted to have been asked to put together a 'radio experience' for him.

Eleven-year-old Oliver, here in the photo with his younger brother Joseph, has given us a list of his, his family's, and his friends' favourite tracks, and you'll be able to hear them on a special episode of *The Music Box* tomorrow morning at 9am (Bank Holiday Monday 3rd May). 

Oliver, who lives in Burnham, goes to Burnham Grammar School, and likes Minecraft "a lot", will also be interviewed live on *Breakfast* with Pat and Lucy tomorrow morning at around 8.30am. 

Well done Oliver - we hope you enjoy your radio experience with us!
