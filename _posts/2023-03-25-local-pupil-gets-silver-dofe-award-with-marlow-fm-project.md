Jamie produced a radio programme on sport and music, and it will be broadcast for the first time on The Music Box on Monday 27th March at 9pm. 

John commented: “Jamie has always loved the radio, and this is his opportunity to entertain you with a great show he's put together. His Silver DofE Award is thoroughly deserved."
