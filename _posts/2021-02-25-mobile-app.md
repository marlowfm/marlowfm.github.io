You can now find our phone and tablet app in Apple's *App Store* and on *Google Play* for Android devices - just search for 'Marlow FM' (make sure you get the one with our logo on).

Most people still listen to us on good old FM, but we know more and more are choosing to listen to our online stream on their phones and tablets*. Our new app makes this much easier to do. 

We've kept the design of the app nice and simple. There's a play button and a stop button - that's it really! You can also touch the Marlow FM logo at the top to go to our website inside the app, or touch the bar at the bottom to go straight to the listings page. 

The same now-and-next programme information you see on our website also appears in the app. 

We hope you enjoy using it! 

You can send any feedback to [info@marlowfm.co.uk](mailto:info@marlowfm.co.uk), or leave a review with Apple or Google. 

*Footnote* 

Just over a quarter (27%) of over-15s claim to listen to live radio via a phone or tablet at least once a month, according to the most recent data from RAJAR, the official body in charge of measuring radio audiences in the UK, published on 14 May 2020. RAJAR has stopped reporting for the time being because of the pandemic.
