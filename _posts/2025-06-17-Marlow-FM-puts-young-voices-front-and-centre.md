We're stepping up our work with young people following our move to Great Marlow School last year. New programme _Stuart on Sunday_, with teacher Stuart Ross, is leading the charge.

Launched at the beginning of June, the lively, family-friendly show already features a team of 20 young contributors who help shape everything from creating jingles to planning content. A talented Year 11 student helps produce all this audio.

Two exciting new features are set to launch soon. _Zoo Radio_, starting on 27th July, will give the youngsters more time behind the mic, while _Take Over_ will invite teams to plan and present their own 20-minute slots - with the winners getting hands-on training at the Marlow FM broadcast desk.

In just a short space of time, the students are gaining confidence, building skills, and becoming part of the Marlow FM family.

The programme comes after the success of Jonny Ratner and Lisa BHA's _Teacher Feature_ on _Breakfast_, and reflects Marlow FM's commitment to giving the next generation real experience in community radio.
