Marlow FM, in partnership with the Town Council and the Chamber of Trade and Commerce, wants to recognise the people in our town who are going the extra mile to help their neighbours and local community, and make Marlow a better place to live, work, and visit during this difficult year.

So many people have made a difference to the lives of others in 2020. Someone who's given up their time to help out their family or friends in need. A business that's come up with innovative ways to support the town during lockdown and beyond. A group that's come together to make sure the most vulnerable are cared for. 

If you know someone in our community who deserves recognition for the things they do, please nominate them for a Hidden Hero Award. A panel from Marlow FM, the Town Council, and the Chamber will choose the worthy winners. 

The deadline for nominations is 4th December. The winners will be announced during a virtual black-tie event live on air in December!
