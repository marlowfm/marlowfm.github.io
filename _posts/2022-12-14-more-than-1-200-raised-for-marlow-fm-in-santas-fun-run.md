W﻿e'd like to thank everyone who gave so generously, and especially the Rotary Clubs of Marlow, who made a donation from their charity pool. The money will help Marlow FM continue to serve the community. 

W﻿e'd also like to thank everyone who joined the Marlow FM team. It was the first time our station had put a team together for the event - a big thank you to Chris Zaremba for making it happen. 

W﻿ell done everyone!
