This year's Santa's Fun Run takes place on Sunday 4th December, and we'd love you to be part of the Marlow FM team.

Join a bunch of Marlow FM presenters and listeners running, or perhaps walking, around the town dressed in Santa outfits, and maybe raise a little money too for your local community radio station. 

If you'd like to join our team, Marlow FM presenter Chris Zaremba has put together [this document with all the details you need]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/other_documents/Enter Marlow Santa's Fun Run as part of the Marlow FM team.docx){:target="_blank"}. 

If you'd prefer to send a donation our way instead, [our fundraising page is here](https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/marlowfm-runningteam-1){:target="_blank"}.
