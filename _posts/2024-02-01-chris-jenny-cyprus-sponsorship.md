Our very own Chris Zaremba and his wife Jenny are looking for support as they prepare for sponsored runs in Cyprus in March. If they raise Â£500, Jenny's running club will match this amount.

Jenny will be running the half-marathon, and Chris the 10K. [Please consider sponsoring them](https://justgiving.com/crowdfunding/marlowfmrun){:target="\_blank"} - money goes towards our new studios at Great Marlow School.
