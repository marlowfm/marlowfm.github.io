We're chuffed that we've been nominated for a total of seven [Community Radio Awards](https://communityradioawards.org.uk/){:target="_blank"} this year, more than any other community radio station.

The station itself has picked up nominations in the Outside Broadcast of the Year and Covid and Community Response categories. This is for covering the Marlow Christmas Drive-In and Marlow's Quiet Night In events, and for hosting the Hidden Heroes awards that celebrated the town's heroes during the pandemic. 

Presenters Amelia Slaughter and Angie Burns are both up for Female Presenter of the Year, and Edan Gaskell for Newcomer of the Year. *The Rock Shop with Michelle Livings* is nominated for Specialist Music Show of the Year. 

Our new mobile phone app, which was built by one of our own volunteers, Luke Morton, is in the running for the Innovation Award. 

More than 430 entries from stations around the UK were whittled down to five per category. You can [see and listen to all of our entries here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/cra2021/). 

It's been a tough 18 months for us, what with the pandemic, a drop in income, and the flooding at Longridge. But these nominations, the most we've ever had, prove we fought back and made a real difference to the community. We're all really proud. 

The winners will be revealed in a ceremony at the Coventry Transport Museum on 23 October. 

Good luck everyone!
