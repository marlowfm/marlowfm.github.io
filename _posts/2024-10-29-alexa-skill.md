An [Alexa Skill](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0DGQ78LDB/){:target="\_blank"} is now available for Marlow FM. This means you can play your favourite radio station on Amazon smart speakers even faster, without hearing lots of ads first.

To use it, first enable the skill by saying "Alexa, enable the Marlow FM skill" (you can also do this in the Alexa mobile phone app, if you use it). From then on, just say "Alexa, play Marlow FM", or "Alexa, Marlow FM". That's it!

We intend to work on a similar feature for Google smart speakers.
