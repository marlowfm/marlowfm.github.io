We're celebrating success at this year's [Community Radio Awards](https://communityradioawards.org.uk/){:target="_blank"}.

Gemma-Leigh James won silver in the female presenter category. She presents *Breakfast* on Thursdays and *Afternoon Gold 90s*. 

Amelia Slaughter's *She Said What?* also took silver in the entertainment show category. Its mix of music and showbiz gossip goes out every Saturday at midday. 

Well done Gemma-Leigh and Amelia! 

We also congratulate Lucy Ashburner, who was shortlisted for young person of the year, and Angie Burns, for newcomer of the year. 

More than 460 entries from 90 radio stations were whittled down to five per category. 

It's been a challenging year for our presenters because of the virus, and so this recognition is fantastic.
