[Mr James](https://mrjamesmarlow.co.uk/){:target="\_blank"}, the tailor well known around Marlow and beyond, is very kindly supporting our new studio building fundraising.

Mr James will generously donate 10% of all made-to-measure orders placed during the month of August.

Specialising in all things made to measure, Mr James offers a wide range of options, including formal and casual shirts, chinos, polos, overcoats, suits, and, now, made-to-measure gilets.

The fitter at Mr James, James Mulchrone, is, of course, also a familiar voice on Marlow FM.

A big thank you, Mr James, from everyone at the station.
