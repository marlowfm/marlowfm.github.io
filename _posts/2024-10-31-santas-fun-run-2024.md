This year's Santa's Fun Run in Marlow takes place on Sunday 1st December, and we'd love you to support the Marlow FM team.

Marlow FM presenter Chris Zaremba is once again leading our efforts, and this year money raised will be put towards new computer equipment.

If you're able to send a donation our way, [our fundraising page is here](https://justgiving.com/crowdfunding/marlowfm-santarun){:target="\_blank"}. Thank you.
