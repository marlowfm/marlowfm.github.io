Concert goers will be treated to an unforgettable evening of toe-tapping vintage vocals and uplifting classical music, with breath-taking Spitfire, parachute, cavalry, cannon, and firework displays, all in stunning, stately home settings.

The events are taking place in July and August at Blenheim Palace, Burghley House, Hatfield Park, and Highclere Castle.
