Everyone at Marlow FM wishes you a merry Christmas and a happy new year (here are some of us at our Christmas party!).

We've had some amazing compliments from our listeners during 2023. We plan to bring you even more great shows next year, and eventually from brand new studios at Great Marlow School (thank you for helping us make this a reality with your continued financial support).

We've got lots of shows on throughout the festive period. Don't forget to join Graham and Luke for the Christmas Cavalcade - live at 10am on Christmas Day!
