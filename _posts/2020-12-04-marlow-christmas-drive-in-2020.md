The new community festival is run by the team behind Pub in the Park, and will be held at the Marlow Rugby Club. It will feature a mix of carol concerts, Nativity plays, and other performances - and our very own Hidden Heroes Awards Ceremony on Saturday 19th December from 6pm. 

With three events per day, each welcoming up to 400 people per event, the drive-in will allow the community of Marlow to gather safely in a fully Covid-compliant manner and celebrate Christmas after an incredibly challenging year. 

So drive in and park up, or tune in on Marlow FM!
