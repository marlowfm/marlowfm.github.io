The winners will be announced at a fun-filled Mexican fiesta-inspired evening on Saturday 18th February, where we will celebrate our hidden gems, dine in style, and party the night away - fabuloso!

Tickets for the awards party have now sold out, but you can still bid for some great items in our online auction to raise money for Marlow FM. [All the details are here.](https://www.marlowfm.co.uk/gems/)
