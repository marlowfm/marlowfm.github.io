We took away two awards at last night's [Community Radio Awards](https://communityradioawards.org.uk/){:target="\_blank"}. Pat Reading won Gold for _Sage Person of the Year_, and Lizzie Sentance (pictured) was the Bronze winner for _Presenter of the Year: Woman_.

The winners were revealed in a ceremony in Bradford.

We're all thrilled at Pat and Lizzie's success. Well done to everyone who helped represent Marlow FM in the awards - we submitted 16 entries. What a team!
