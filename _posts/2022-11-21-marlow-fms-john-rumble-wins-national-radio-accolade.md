W﻿e're over the moon that o﻿ur head of training, John Rumble, collected the bronze award in the *Sage Person* category at this year's [Community Radio Awards](https://communityradioawards.org.uk/){:target="_blank"}. The category recognises people over the age of 60.

I﻿t's fantastic that John, who leads our *Faith Matters* programme, and does so much more behind the scenes, has got the recognition he deserves. 

T﻿he awards ceremony took place in Bedford on 19 November. We were also up for *Outside Broadcast of the Year* for our coverage of this year's Marlow Town Regatta and Festival.
