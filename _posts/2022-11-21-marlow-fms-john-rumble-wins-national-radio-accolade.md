I﻿t's fantastic that John, who leads our *Faith Matters* programme, and does so much more behind the scenes, has got the recognition he deserves. 

T﻿he awards ceremony took place in Bedford on 19 November. We were also up for *Outside Broadcast of the Year* for our coverage of this year's Marlow Town Regatta and Festival.
