Folk by the Oak is just outside of London, but it feels a million miles away. This one-day festival is surrounded by the leafy green parkland of Hatfield House, where you'll be immersed in music, history, ancient oaks, bunting, fun and laughter. From the intimacy of the Acorn Stage to the open-air festival buzz of the Main Stage, you'll enjoy performances from award-winning musicians and inspiring new talent in one memorable day.

To be entered into the free draw, email [studio@marlowfm.co.uk](mailto:studio@marlowfm.co.uk) with 'Folk by the Oak Ticket Draw' in the subject line, and include your name and a contact phone number. Entry to the draw closes at midnight on Sunday 7th July. You may only enter once. Members of Marlow FM and their close relatives aren't allowed to enter.
