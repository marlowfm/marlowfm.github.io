Our environment programme, *The Eco Show*, presented by Dora Hargitai and Toby Brown, has been nominated for Radio Programme of the Year in the [Broadcasting Press Guild Awards](https://www.broadcastingpressguild.org/2022/03/bpg-awards-2022-audio-nominations-revealed/){:target="_blank"}. Other nominees in the category include BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour and Times Radio's breakfast programme.

The BPG Television, Streaming and Audio Awards are prized by programme-makers because they're chosen independently by radio and TV correspondents, critics, and previewers. 

*The Eco Show* goes out every Monday evening at 7pm. In past weeks, Dora and Toby have interviewed Jeremy Corbyn and other protestors at the 'Kill The Bill' demonstration in London, Louis McKechnie, the 23-year-old activist who went to prison after taking part in the controversial Insulate Britain environmental campaign group actions, and Todd Smith, a former pilot turned climate activist. 

We know Dora and Toby work hard to put out informative and thought-provoking shows, but this recognition from the professionals, which came out of the blue, is amazing. Marlow FM is a volunteer-run community station that's going head-to-head with the BBC and commercial radio. 

The 48th annual BPG Awards ceremony will take place at lunchtime on Friday 25th March at The Brewery in the City of London. 

Good luck Dora and Toby!
