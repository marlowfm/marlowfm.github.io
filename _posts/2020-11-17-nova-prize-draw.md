**Nova Fine Art**

Nova Fine Art will bring new and emerging artists to Marlow, with a collection of original paintings, limited edition prints, and sculptures. 

They know all their artists personally, and take the time to understand the narrative behind each extraordinary artwork. Every picture does tell a story, and it's one Nova would love to share with you. 

Gallery manager Alex Kappas brings with him 12 years' experience in running galleries and art history lecturing. 

Community is so important to Nova, which is why they want to help Marlow FM.
