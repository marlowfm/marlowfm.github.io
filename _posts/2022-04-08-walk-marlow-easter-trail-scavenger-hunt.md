As a member of the Marlow Chamber of Trade and Commerce, Marlow FM encourages you to sign up and join in this Easter trail and scavenger hunt!

Bring your friends, your family - and even your dog - and this Easter take part in 'Walk Marlow', the Chamber's brand new take on a local scavenger hunt, organised exclusively for Marlow residents and guests. 

In a little over 90 mins, the out-and-back loop of the town will take you round all the main sights, but also reveal some of its hidden gems. And a series of cryptic clues and challenges will help involve everyone, young and old, in searching, collecting and solving clues. 

And for the adults, there's an additional - albeit optional - quiz that comes with its own prize.

All the details can be found here: <https://www.eventbrite.com/e/walk-marlow-registration-296690217427?aff=chamberwebsite>
