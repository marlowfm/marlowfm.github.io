#### A unique way to explore

Bring your friends, your family - and even your dog - and join us this Easter taking part in 'Walk Marlow', the Chamber's brand new take on a local scavenger hunt, organised exclusively for Marlow residents and guests. 

​In a little over 90 mins, our out-and-back loop of the Town will take you round all the main sights, but also reveal some of its hidden gems. And our series of cryptic clues and challenges will help involve everyone, young and old, in searching, collecting and solving clues. 

​And for the adults, we have an additional - albeit optional - quiz that comes with its own prize.
