Folk by the Oak is just outside of London, but it feels a million miles away. This one-day festival is surrounded by the leafy green parkland of Hatfield House, where you'll be immersed in music, history, ancient oaks, bunting, fun and laughter. From the intimacy of the Acorn Stage to the open-air festival buzz of the Main Stage, you'll enjoy performances from award-winning musicians and inspiring new talent in one memorable day. 

To win a family ticket, just answer the following question: **In what year did the first Folk by the Oak festival take place?** 

Email your answer with the subject 'Folk by the Oak competition' along with your name and a contact phone number to [studio@marlowfm.co.uk](mailto:studio@marlowfm.co.uk). Entry to the draw closes at 5pm on Thursday 14th July. You may only enter once. Members of Marlow FM and their close relatives aren't allowed to enter.
