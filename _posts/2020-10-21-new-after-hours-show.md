We're launching a new two-hour late night dance music show this week.

*After Hours* will go out every Friday night/Saturday morning from midnight to 2am, after *Residency Essential Mix*. 

With the pandemic keeping clubs and raves shut for the time being, *After Hours* brings the freshest club tracks that would normally be rocking dancefloors. 

The show is presented by Monty Ozanne, a DJ, producer, and event promoter. He began his DJ career in the house music scene of the south coast, supporting artists like Camelphat and Solardo. 

As a producer, he's been supported by world-leading DJs, and has a new release coming in November 2020 on High Tide Recordings.
