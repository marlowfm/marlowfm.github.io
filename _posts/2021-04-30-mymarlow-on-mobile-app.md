We've teamed up with the popular local news website MyMarlow to bring you their latest stories on our phone and tablet app.

We know many of our listeners are also avid readers of MyMarlow, and so we think they'll find the new MyMarlow screen inside our app really useful. You can see the opening lines of each story, and then tap through to the MyMarlow site to read a story in full. 

We launched the first version of our app back in February. The latest version 1.4 is still just as easy to use, but it's now got lots of extra features like the Marlow FM schedule and local weather and travel information. It's available in Apple's *App Store* and on *Google Play* for Android devices.
