<p>
	After three years away, the Marlow FM 97.5 Hidden Gems Awards, celebrating all
	that is great about Marlow and its people, are back!
</p>

<p>
	The winners will be announced at a fun-filled Mexican fiesta-inspired evening
	on Saturday 18th February, where we will celebrate our hidden gems, dine in
	style, and party the night away - fabuloso!
</p>

<p>
	Tickets are available for just £40 a head. There are
	tables of 10, so do bring your friends, or make new ones joining a table!
	Dress to impress, anything from black tie to your best mariachi band outfit...
</p>

<p>
	The location is Holy Trinity School (map below), which will be transformed
	into an indoor marquee. There will be fantastic Mexican food, including a
	welcome glass of Mexican sangria, a round of the Heads & Tails game, a raffle,
	a piñata to bash to win £100, and dancing till midnight.
</p>

<p>
	Do come and join us for a fabulous time as we honour the unsung heroes in our
	community and celebrate 12 wonderful years of Marlow FM!
