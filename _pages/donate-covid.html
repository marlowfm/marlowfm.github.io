<h3>Why you might want to think about helping us</h3>
<p>
	Everyone at Marlow FM is an unpaid volunteer. We love radio, and we love
	providing a service to the people of Marlow.
</p>

<p>
	We're a
	<a
		href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/manage-your-licence/radio-broadcast-licensing/community-radio"
		target="_blank"
		>not-for-profit community radio station</a
	>. This means that although we can get some money from advertising, most of
	our money comes from fundraising - in particular, from doing outside
	broadcasts and running events.
</p>

<p>
	2020 was a difficult year for us, like for many, of course. Most of the
	events around town where you'd usually expect to see us were cancelled,
	and our income was way down. We have always cut costs to the bone, and our
	friends at Longridge are generous, but we still have some hefty costs to pay
	each year.
</p>

<p>
	If you're in a position to donate something towards your local radio station,
	we would appreciate it tremendously. Thank you.
</p>
