<h3>We needed to leave Longridge</h3>

<p>
	Our original studio building, at Longridge, is going to be demolished, so we
	had to move to a new home (at the moment we're temporarily based at Marlow
	Library).
</p>

<p>
	The good news is that we've been offered a fantastic location at Great Marlow
	School, in the old caretaker's garage, but it will take a lot of work to
	convert it. And we'll need money we don't have at the moment.
</p>

<p>
	We're looking at several options for the site. But we'd like to raise as much
	as we can so that we have a new home to be proud of, some much-needed new
	equipment, and a base from which we can do even more in the community,
	including with local schools.
</p>

<h3>Why you might want to think about helping us</h3>

<p>
	Everyone at Marlow FM is an unpaid volunteer. We love radio, and we love
	providing a service to the people of Marlow.
</p>

<p>
	We're a
	<a
		href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/manage-your-licence/radio-broadcast-licensing/community-radio"
		target="_blank"
		>not-for-profit community radio station</a
	>. This means that although we can get some money from advertising, most of
	our money comes from fundraising - for example, from doing outside broadcasts
	and running events.
</p>

<p>
	If you're in a position to donate something towards your local radio station,
	we would appreciate it tremendously. Thank you.
</p>
