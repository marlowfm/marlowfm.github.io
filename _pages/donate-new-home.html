<h3>We need to leave Longridge later this year</h3>

<p>
	Our current studio building at Longridge, our home since 2011, is being
	demolished later this year, so we have to move to a new home.
</p>

<p>
	The good news is that we've been offered a fantastic location at Great Marlow
	School, in the old caretaker's garage, but it will take a lot of work to
	convert it. And we'll need money we don't have at the moment.
</p>

<p>
	We're looking at several options for the site. But we'd like to raise as much
	as we can so that we have a new home to be proud of, some much-needed new
	equipment, and a base from which we can do even more in the community,
	including with local schools.
</p>

<h3>Why you might want to think about helping us</h3>

<p>
	Everyone at Marlow FM is an unpaid volunteer. We love radio, and we love
	providing a service to the people of Marlow.
</p>

<p>
	We're a
	<a
		href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/manage-your-licence/radio-broadcast-licensing/community-radio"
		target="_blank"
		>not-for-profit community radio station</a
	>. This means that although we can get some money from advertising, most of
	our money comes from fundraising - for example, from doing outside broadcasts
	and running events.
</p>

<p>
	If you're in a position to donate something towards your local radio station,
	we would appreciate it tremendously. Thank you.
</p>
