<p>
	Marlow FM is dedicated to producing the very best radio for the community we
	love - in and around Marlow. This requires money, and even though everyone at
	Marlow FM is a volunteer, we have costs we have to meet. So we're asking you
	now to sponsor the Marlow FM team in this year's Santa's Fun Run on Sunday 4th
	December, organised by the Rotary Clubs of Marlow.
</p>

<p>
	The team is made up of presenters, listeners, and others who like having
	Marlow FM as part of the community. You sponsor the whole team, not individual
	members, and you do this at
	<a href="https://bit.ly/marlowfmsantarun" target="_blank"
		>bit.ly/marlowfmsantarun</a
	>, or just go to the JustGiving site and search for 'marlowfm'.
</p>

<p>
	We want to continue to serve the community as we have for more than a decade.
	Please sponsor us to help that happen. Thank you.
</p>
