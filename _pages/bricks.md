We'll be putting up a supporters' wall inside our new studio building, and we're giving you the opportunity to add an engraved brick to it!

For just £97.50, you get a permanent way to show your support for Marlow FM and the service we give.

Fill in one or both lines below, with up to 16 characters per line. Feel free to find a 'brick buddy' and have a line each!

### Terms and conditions

- At this early stage of the project, we can't guarantee how the supporters' wall will exactly look, where it will be positioned in the building, or when it will go up. But rest assured we want the wall to take pride of place in our new home!
- We reserve the right to reject or modify any text that we consider unsuitable for display.
- 'Buy a brick' is a donation to Marlow FM, and not a purchase of goods or services. So you're not entitled to a refund or exchange unless we make a mistake.
- We'll tell you when your brick is installed, and invite you to visit the new studios and see your brick in person.
