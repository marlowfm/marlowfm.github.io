![Buy a brick for Marlow FM](/assets/images/other/buy-a-brick-1.png){: .align-right}
We'll be putting up a [supporters' wall](/wall) inside our [new studio building](/donate), and you can add an engraved brick to it!

For just £97.50, your support for Marlow FM and the service we give will be on display for years to come.

![Buy a brick for Marlow FM](/assets/images/other/buy-a-brick-2.jpg)

Fill in either one or both lines below, with up to 16 characters per line (if you don't need the second line, just leave it blank). Feel free to find a 'brick buddy' if you want to split the cost and have a line each!

If you can't wait to see your brick in real life, [take a look at the online version](/wall).

### Terms and conditions

- At this stage of the project, we can't guarantee for sure how the supporters' wall will look, where it will be positioned in the building, or when it will go up. But rest assured we want the wall to take pride of place in our new home!
- We reserve the right to modify or reject any text that we consider unsuitable for display.
- 'Buy a brick' is a donation to Marlow FM, and not a purchase of goods or services. So you're not entitled to a refund or exchange unless we make a mistake.
- We'll tell you when your brick is installed, and invite you to visit the new studios and see your brick in person.
