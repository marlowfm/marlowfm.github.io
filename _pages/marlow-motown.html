<p>
	Join us on Saturday 30th September at Marlow Bottom Village Hall (63 Marlow
	Bottom Road, SL7 3NA) for a night of fun, head-scratching, and fundraising for
	your local community radio station.
</p>

<p>
	Our presenters Tom Brown and Nikky Smart will run the quiz, and you can make
	up a team of up to eight people (or just buy a ticket and we'll put you in a
	team!).
</p>

<p>
	There will be a <b>cash-only</b> bar, but feel free to bring your own snacks.
	Doors will open at 7pm, and the quiz will start promptly at 7.30pm.
</p>

<p>
	You can buy tickets, at just Â£10 a person, by clicking the button below -
	please bring your receipt email along on paper or on your phone. The night
	will be a lot of fun, so do invite all your friends!
