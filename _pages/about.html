<p>
	Marlow FM broadcasts a mix of music and talk, and regularly comes live from
	events in the town. It's available on 97.5 FM in Marlow and the surrounding
	area, and streams online.
</p>

<h2>Why we're here</h2>
<p>
	Marlow FM is a not-for-profit organisation staffed by volunteers. We run a
	community radio station for the people of Marlow.
</p>
<p>We exist to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Be a focal point to bring the community closer together</li>
	<li>Provide a platform to give local people and organisations a voice</li>
	<li>
		Keep listeners up to date with local news, travel information, and weather
	</li>
	<li>
		Create opportunities for young people in the area to pursue careers in radio
		and related fields
	</li>
	<li>
		Give businesses the opportunity to advertise their products and services to
		the community at reasonable prices
	</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Be one of the best community radio stations in the country</li>
	<li>Develop our links with local schools and colleges</li>
</ul>

<h2>How we started</h2>
<p>
	Marlow resident Tim Ashburner conceived the idea for Marlow FM in 2006. After
	two four-week test broadcasts in 2007 and 2009, from a church hall and a pub,
	Ofcom granted Marlow FM a full-time community radio licence. The station went
	on air from its original studios at Longridge, Quarry Wood Road, Marlow at
	midday on Wednesday 11th May 2011.
