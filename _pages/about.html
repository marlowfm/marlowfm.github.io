<h2>How we started</h2>
<p>Marlow resident Tim Ashburner conceived the idea for Marlow FM in 2006. After two four-week test broadcasts in 2007 and 2009, from a church hall and a pub, Ofcom granted Marlow FM a full-time community radio licence. The station went on air from its studios at Longridge, Quarry Wood Road, Marlow at midday on Wednesday May the 11th 2011.</p>
