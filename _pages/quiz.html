<p>
	The Marlow FM Quiz Night is back! Join us on Saturday 15th October in the hall
	at Holy Trinity School (Wethered Road, SL7 3AG - map below) for a night of
	fun, head-scratching, and fundraising for your local community radio station.
</p>

<p>
	Our very own DJ Dan will run the quiz, and you can make up a team of up to
	eight people (or just buy a ticket and we'll put you in a team!). There will
	be a cash-or-card bar, but feel free to bring your own snacks. Doors will open at
	7pm, and the quiz will start promptly at 7.30pm.
</p>

<p>
	You can buy tickets, at just Â£10 a person, by clicking the button below -
	please bring your receipt email along on paper or on your phone. The night is
	always a lot of fun, so do invite all your friends!
