<p>
	The Marlow FM Quiz Night is back! Join us on Saturday 15th October at Holy
	Trinity School (Wethered Road, SL7 3AG - map below) for a night of fun,
	head-scratching, and fundraising for your local community radio station.
</p>

<p>
	Our very own DJ Dan will run the quiz this time, and you can make up a team of
	up to eight people. There will be a bar, but feel free to bring your own
	snacks. Doors will open at Xpm, and the quiz will start promptly at Ypm.
</p>

<p>
	You can buy tickets at just Â£10 a person by clicking the button below - please
	bring your receipt email along on paper or on your phone. The night is always
	a lot of fun, so do invite all your friends!
