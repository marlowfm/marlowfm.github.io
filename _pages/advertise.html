<p>
	We welcome advertisers and sponsors of programmes. If you'd like to find out
	more, email
	<a href="mailto:advertise@marlowfm.co.uk">advertise@marlowfm.co.uk</a>, and
	one of our team will get back to you.
</p>

<p>
	Radio advertising has proved effective time and time again, because people are
	usually busy doing things while they listen, and they switch stations less.
	Advertising on Marlow FM is cost effective too.
</p>

<p>
	We don't have official listening figures. We would need to join RAJAR, the
	official body in charge of measuring radio audiences in the UK, but this is
	prohibitively expensive for community radio stations.
</p>

<p>
	We do monitor online listening. Surveys confirm there are still more
	over-the-air listeners than online listeners - a commonly-accepted ratio is 4
	to 1. Based on that, we estimate more than 700 people tune in to Marlow FM
	each day (there could well be more than this if groups of people are listening
	to the same device). What's more, because we have a more varied range of
	programmes than a mainstream radio station, we believe it's not necessarily
	the same people each day, and so our reach is wider.
