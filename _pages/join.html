<p>If you live in or around Marlow, you can get involved, whether as a presenter, or behind the scenes, or both. We
	don't always have slots immediately available, but we're still keen to hear from you if you'd like to join an existing
	programme, or if you've got an idea for a new one. You don't need any broadcasting experience - we can train you.</p>

<p>We can also offer work experience from time to time. Unfortunately, during this pandemic, we've had to put this on
	hold, as we have fewer live shows than normal, and we're keeping the number of people in the studio to a minimum. We
	intend to start this up again as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If you'd like to introduce yourself, please email <a href="mailto:info@marlowfm.co.uk">info@marlowfm.co.uk</a>.</p>
