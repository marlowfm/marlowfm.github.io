<p>
	If you live in or around Marlow, and are at least 18-years-old, you can get
	involved, whether as a presenter, or behind the scenes, or both. We don't
	always have slots immediately available, but we're still keen to hear from you
	if you'd like to join an existing programme, or if you've got an idea for a
	new one. You don't need any broadcasting experience - we can train you.
</p>

<p>
	If you'd like to introduce yourself, please email
	<a href="mailto:info@marlowfm.co.uk">info@marlowfm.co.uk</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately, we can't, in general, offer work experience. As we have no
	full-time staff, there's usually nobody around all day to take someone under
	their wing. And, for safeguarding reasons, we don't allow anyone under the age
	of 18 to be in the studio without a guardian present.
